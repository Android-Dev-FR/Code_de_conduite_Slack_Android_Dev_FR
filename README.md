### As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.

**These things are NOT OK.**

### If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
* Apologize and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from the Slack. Upon repeat offenses, or if the community believes you are not acting in good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently.

### Privacy
* All conversations are private unless otherwise specified. 
* If you wish to share a conversation, or part of one, you must get permission from each person involved.

### Best Practices
* Stay on topic. The goal of the ASG Slack is to facilitate discussion of things relating to Android development. This could be about marketing, business, server-side programming, or other things that may be important to an Android developer. For off-topic topics go to #random
* If you have a technical question, please try and figure it out before posting here. If you're having trouble, all questions are welcome.
* Before asking any questions, please check if there's a channel for it before asking in #android-general
* Job posting can be posted in #hiring only. Do not reach out to individuals for hiring purposes.

**If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let a moderator know. Here is a list of the current admins and their Slack IDs:**

* Adrienne Park - @adrienne

## Member Nomination  

To nominate someone to join the Android Study Group, log in the [ASG web page](https://asgweb.herokuapp.com/) with your Android Study Group slack account, go in the **Nominate** page, and fill in the form with your name, their name and info, and why you are nominating them. You'll need to have been a member of Android Study Group for 30 or more days to be able to nominate someone. 

This study group is for people actively involved in creating Android applications professionally. This includes people like software engineers and designers, and excludes people like journalists or recruiters. The admins will take into consideration the amount of time the nominee has spent working on Android (at least 1 year is ideal). Other helpful data points include the company where they work (if applicable), apps they have built, and their contributions to the Android community (via open source software, meetups, blog posts, etc). Membership is determined by a vote from the admins, who will then send out an invitation to the nominee.

If there is any person you would like to keep out of the study group for any reason, message one of the admins.  

Because this Slack group is representative of the community, admins reserve the right to deny admission or revoke membership based on CoC violating behavior outside of the Slack chat environment (e.g. in person, GitHub, social media), if necessary.

## Slack Etiquette

### Slack Commands

Many members of ASG have this Slack open during the work day, or installed on their phones. Additionally, there are members in many different time zones. Please be cautious about using  `@channel` or `@everyone` and avoid it if possible.

For tips and tricks or questions about Slack usage, check out #meta.

### Q & A

Value your fellow members' time, and be considerate when asking questions. Before asking a question, please Google for it, and consult the Android documentation. If it is still unclear, please reference the sources you consulted in your question.

When answering questions, avoid condescending language or impatience. We are all trying our hardest! 

## Modération par les administrateurs

Face à un comportement non adéquate d'une personne sur cet espace slack, l'équipe d'admins peut prendre toute action qui lui semble adéquate.
Cela va d'un simple avertissement à l'exclusion du groupe.

Voici une liste d'actions non exhaustives que les administrateurs se réservent le droit de faire : 
* Demander à une personne de reformuler ses propos en faisant preuve de communication non violente*.
* Demander à une personne de s'excuser
* Demander publiquement ou en privé à une personne de cesser les échanges sur un sujet considéré comme une entrave à cette Charte
* Supprimer un ou plusieurs messages voir supprimer un thread complet
* Banir temporairement ou définitivement une personne

Les admins peuvent agir suite au signalement d'un comportement inadéquate par un ou plusieurs membres du groupe, ou de leur propre chef.

#### Les régles de la communication non violente

1. Observer sans juger
2. Partager son ressenti en disant "Je"
3. Exprimer son besoin
4. Demander sans exiger
